# ScrapyProjects
### I was trying to learn web scraping and the first package I used was Scrapy. I myself am interested in IMDb in the projects folder, check it out. it extracts the IMDb 250 top movies and saves it as a json file. you can extend the functionality to scrape the all the movies from the website.
